		<p>Today, the journal Frontiers of Ecology and Evolution published an analysis of a new lion alert system designed to protect lions and help communities thrive. This innovative approach to promoting human-wildlife coexistence was developed with support from the National Geographic Societyâ€™s Big Cats Initiative. Lion populations have plummeted in recent decades due in part to conflict with people. As habitats become more fragmented, lions are more imperiled. In northern Botswana, when lions kill cattle, the villagers often seek revenge by killing lions that may not have been the culprit of the attack.</p>
